# Bank Marketing Project
Bank telemarketing prediction project for CSE 581. The goal of this project was
to predict whether a bank customer would accept a term loan based on
information the bank has obtained about them. Two presentations and a report are
included describing work done for the project. All classifications and
visualizions were done in RapidMiner.
