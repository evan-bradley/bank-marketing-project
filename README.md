# Bank Marketing Project
Bank telemarketing prediction project for CSE 581 (Fall 2016). The goal of
this project was to predict whether a bank customer would accept a term loan
based on information the bank has obtained about them. Two presentations and
a report are included describing work done for the project. All classifications
and visualizions were done in RapidMiner.

# Report
A PDF of the report is available [here](Report/report.pdf)

# Presentations 
Two presentations were given to explain work done on the project.

The first presentation gave a cursory overview of the data with the aim of
predicting what variables would be conducive to predicting whether a customer
would accept a term loan. It is available [here](Presentation_1/presentation_1.pdf).

The second presentation intended to present on the results of the project and
the methods used to obtain those results. It is available
[here](Presentation_2/presentation_2.pdf).
